JavaScript Analysis Masterclass Lab is an interactive educational platform designed to teach JavaScript security analysis techniques. This lab provides a safe environment for practicing various security testing methodologies including breakpoint manipulation, local overrides, and code obfuscation analysis.



## About This Lab

This is a **beginner-level** JavaScript security analysis lab designed to introduce fundamental concepts in web application security. The lab provides hands-on experience with common techniques used in security assessments and penetration testing of JavaScript applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amrelsagaei/JavaScript-Analysis-Masterclass-Lab
```
